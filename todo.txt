Suggested improvements

* Improve DomeCsc as follows:
  * Output the `settingsAppliedDomeTcp` event.

* Improve the ATDome TCP/IP interface as follows:
  * Report invalid commands (unknownc ommands, invalid parameters...)
  * Report SCB link OK and auto shutdown activated in short status
    and do NOT report "auto close enabled" -- save that for full status.

* Improve the SAL XML as follows:
  * Remove moveShutterDropoutDoor and moveShutterMainDoor commands
    or modify them to only allow fully opened or fully closed;
    the TCP/IP interface does not allow anything in between.
  * Remove the stopAzimuth and stopShutter commands;
    the TCP/IP interface does not support them.
  * evt_settingsAppliedDomeController should use the term
    "enabled" instead of "active".
  * Add an event to for rain detected or not detected, and clouds
    detected or not detected (preferably the same event).
  * Preferably combine events for "in position" and state of axes
    e.g. one event for commanded azimuth, state of azimuth and
    azimuth in position, and one event for the same information
    for the two doors.
    Failing that, pick one of azimuthState or azimuthMovingDirection;
    they are entirely redundant.
  * Ditch enums AzimuthState_InMotionState,
    AzimuthState_StoppingMotionState and ShutterDoorState_NotInMotionState;
    none can be output.
  * Consider ditching events internalCommand, internalStatus,
    loopTimeOutOfRange and rejectedCommand. All can use logging instead.
  * Consider ditching event detailedState; this CSC is so simple
    that it doesn't seem necessary.
